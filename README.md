## Introduction
This exercise aims to introduce Geospatial Informatics students to alternative mobile GIS applications beyond **QField** and **ESRI** products. The task involved selecting a mobile GIS app, installing it on a mobile device, testing its functionalities, and documenting the experience. I chose **SW Maps - GIS & Data Collector** by Softwel, available on the Google Play Store.

## Basic Information
**SW Maps** is a versatile and free GIS & data collection application, providing a range of mapping tools suitable for field data collection, spatial analysis, and data management. 

## Application Description Template
An overview and template were established for consistent reporting on the selected applicationâ€™s features, interface, usability, and functionality.

## Application Details
In this section, detailed insights are provided into the capabilities of SW Maps, covering aspects such as:
- **Interface Overview**
- **Data Collection Features**
- **Map Import and Export Options**
- **Attribute Editing**
- **GPS Accuracy and Tracking**

## Working with the Application
During testing, I explored the following functionalities:
- **Creating and editing points, lines, and polygons:** I used various tools for defining spatial features and encountered challenges with polygon creation, but found point and line features intuitive.
- **Data Import/Export:** I successfully imported external datasets and exported data for further analysis in desktop GIS.
- **Attribute Data Management:** The application allows for detailed attribute editing, making it suitable for inventory projects and spatial surveys.

## Summary
Working with SW Maps was an enjoyable experience, with a few minor challenges in polygon creation. Given its robust features and continuous development, this free application has strong potential for users who dedicate time to learning its full capabilities. SW Maps proved highly intuitive, and I would consider it a primary choice for field inventory tasks when ESRI products are unavailable.

Despite some limitations, with proper setup, SW Maps could compete with applications like **Field Maps**. The app offers a comprehensive range of GIS functions, and ongoing updates suggest that any current limitations may be addressed in future releases, enhancing its standing as a top free mGIS tool.
